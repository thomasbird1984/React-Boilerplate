# PDS Dictionary

This folder contains dictionary files for spellchecking in IntelliJ IDEA / WebStorm.

To add this dictionary to your IDE, follow these instructions:

- Go to `Preferences / Editor / Spelling`

When adding words to the dictionary, they must be all lowercase. 
There is no syntax other than a list of lowercase words.
